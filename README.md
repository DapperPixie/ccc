# ccc - Common Computer Crap
Things I'm tired of reimplementing.
# Description
Contains the following:
  Bitwise integer representation
  Simplified Buffer Object
  Color (RGBA/HSVA) Object
  Multiple containers (RAIIPool, LRU cache)
  A few mathy functions I tend to use too oftem
  Very simple memory telemetry
  A mechanism to provide basic system information. (OS, OS name, endianness, etc)
  Utilities like a truly generic to_string, basic noncopyable/nonconstruct implementation.
  
# Why not use Boost?
I don't like to use Boost; It's quite a heavy requirement, even if the STL implements portions of it.
